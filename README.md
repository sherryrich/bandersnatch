# Bandersnatch

Inspiration for this project came from The episode entitled [Bandersnatch](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9495224/) from Netflix's popular series Black Mirror. The basic concept of the game is where the user gets to choose different scanerios and possible paths which determine the outcome of the story.
