# Introduction - Bandersnatch

Inspiration for this project came from Netflix's popular series Black Mirror. A particular episode entitled [Bandersnatch](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9495224/) where the user gets to choose different scanerios and possible paths which determine the outcome of the story.

A deployed link to the website can be found [here](https://sherryrich.github.io/bandersnatch/)
